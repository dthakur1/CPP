#### Please add your comments below in case your implementation is not fully working:

* Part 1: Fully working. 
* Part 2: I'm not able to handle the ffr() function and the refrence objects.

* Part 2: Also, the test on line 267 prints the correct output but for some reason the
          time-zone is printed out differently. 
          (Its supposed to be EST but my output shows DST).
          Im not sure if this is a problem with my code.
          I have included the test case with these two things commented out.
